        <br />
        Let's assign some string values to some variables. <br />
        var city0 = "Atlanta"; <br />
        var city1 = "Baltimore"; <br />
        var city2 = "Chicago"; <br />
        var city3 = "Denver"; <br />
        var city4 = "Los Angeles"; <br />
        var city5 = "Seattle"; <br />
        The variable names are all the same, except they end in different
        numbers. I could have <br />
        named the variables buffy, the, vampireSlayer, and so on if I'd wanted
        to, but I chose to <br />
        name them this way because of where this discussion is going. <br />
        Now, having made these assignments, if I code... <br />
        alert("Welcome to " + city3); <br />
        ...an alert displays saying, "Welcome to Denver". <br />
        I'm going to show you another type of variable, one that will come in
        handy for many <br />
        tasks that you'll learn about in later chapters. I'm talking about a
        type of variable called an <br />
        array. Whereas an ordinary variable has a single value assigned to
        it—for example, 9 or <br />
        "Paris"—an array is a variable that can have multiple values assigned to
        it. You define an <br />
        array this way: <br />
        var cities = ["Atlanta", "Baltimore", "Chicago", "Denver", "Los
        Angeles", "Seattle"]; <br />
        In the example at the beginning of this chapter, I ended each variable
        name with a number. <br />
        city0 was "Atlanta", city1 was "Baltimore", and so on. The array I just
        defined is similar, <br />
        but in the case of an array defined the way I just defined one,
        JavaScript numbers the different <br />
        values, or elements, automatically. (You can control the numbering
        yourself by defining <br />
        elements individually. See below.) And you refer to each element by
        writing the array name <br />
        —cities in this case—followed by a number enclosed in square brackets.
        cities[0] is <br />
        "Atlanta", cities[1] is "Baltimore", and so on. <br />
        Because JavaScript automatically numbers array elements, you have no say
        in the <br />
        numbering. The first element in the list always has an index of 0, the
        second element an index <br />
        of 1, and so on. <br />
        This is the alert I coded above, but now specifying an array element
        instead of an <br />
        ordinary variable. <br />
        alert("Welcome to " + cities[3]); <br />
        An array can be assigned any type of value that you can assign to
        ordinary variables. You <br />
        can even mix the different types in the same array (not that you would
        ordinarily want to). <br />
        var mixedArray = [1, "Bob", "Now is", true]; <br />
        In the example above, mixedArray[0] has a numerical value of 1,
        mixedArray[1] has a <br />
        string value of "Bob", and so on. <br />
        Things to keep in mind: <br />
        The first item always has an index of 0, not 1. This means that if the
        last item in the list <br />
        has an index of 9, there are 10 items in the list. <br />
        The same naming rules you learned for ordinary variables apply. Only
        letters, numbers, $ <br />
        and _ are legal. The first character can't be a number. No spaces.
        <br />
        Coders often prefer to make array names plural—cities instead of city,
        for example— <br />
        since an array is a list of things. <br />
        Like an ordinary variable, you declare an array only once. If you assign
        new values to an <br />
        array that has already been declared, you drop the var. <br />
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="moiz">
      <h1>-: Arrays: Adding and removing elements :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        As you learned in earlier chapters, you can declare an empty variable,
        one that doesn't <br />
        have a value. Then you can assign it a value whenever you like. And you
        can change its value <br />
        at will. You can do all these things with an array, as well. <br />
        This is how you declare an empty array. <br />
        var pets = []; <br />
        Assume that the array pets has already been declared. This is how you
        assign values to <br />
        it. <br />
        1 pets[0] = "dog"; <br />
        2 pets[1] = "cat"; <br />
        3 pets[2] = "bird"; <br />
        In the example above, I defined the first three elements of the array,
        in order. But you can <br />
        legally leave gaps in an array if you choose to (not that you normally
        would). For example, <br />
        suppose you start with the same empty array and code these lines. <br />
        1 pets[3] = "lizard"; <br />
        2 pets[6] = "snake"; <br />
        Now, if you refer to pets[3], you'll get "lizard". If you refer to
        pets[6], you'll get <br />
        "snake". But if you refer to pets[0] through pets[2] or pets[4] or
        pets[5], you'll get <br />
        undefined. <br />
        You can assign additional values to an array that already has values.
        Assume that the first <br />
        three elements of the array pets are "dog", "cat", and "bird". Then you
        write this code. <br />
        1 pets[3] = "lizard"; <br />
        2 pets[4] = "fish"; <br />
        3 pets[5] = "gerbil"; <br />
        4 pets[6] = "snake"; <br />
        Now the array has 7 elements: "dog", "cat", "bird", "lizard", "fish",
        "gerbil", and "snake". <br />
        If you assign a new value to an array element that already has one, the
        old value is <br />
        replaced by the new one. <br />
        Using the keyword, pop, you can remove the last element of an array.
        <br />
        Suppose you have an array, pets, whose elements are "dog", "cat", and
        "bird". The <br />
        following code deletes the last element, "bird", leaving a two-element
        array. <br />
        pets.pop(); <br />
        Using the keyword, push, you can add one or more elements to the end of
        an array. <br />
        Suppose you have that same array consisting of "dog", "cat", and "bird".
        The following <br />
        code adds two new elements to the end of the array. <br />
        pets.push("fish", "ferret"); <br />
        <br />
