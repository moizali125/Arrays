        <br />
        Let's assign some string values to some variables. <br />
        var city0 = "Atlanta"; <br />
        var city1 = "Baltimore"; <br />
        var city2 = "Chicago"; <br />
        var city3 = "Denver"; <br />
        var city4 = "Los Angeles"; <br />
        var city5 = "Seattle"; <br />
        The variable names are all the same, except they end in different
        numbers. I could have <br />
        named the variables buffy, the, vampireSlayer, and so on if I'd wanted
        to, but I chose to <br />
        name them this way because of where this discussion is going. <br />
        Now, having made these assignments, if I code... <br />
        alert("Welcome to " + city3); <br />
        ...an alert displays saying, "Welcome to Denver". <br />
        I'm going to show you another type of variable, one that will come in
        handy for many <br />
        tasks that you'll learn about in later chapters. I'm talking about a
        type of variable called an <br />
        array. Whereas an ordinary variable has a single value assigned to
        it—for example, 9 or <br />
        "Paris"—an array is a variable that can have multiple values assigned to
        it. You define an <br />
        array this way: <br />
        var cities = ["Atlanta", "Baltimore", "Chicago", "Denver", "Los
        Angeles", "Seattle"]; <br />
        In the example at the beginning of this chapter, I ended each variable
        name with a number. <br />
        city0 was "Atlanta", city1 was "Baltimore", and so on. The array I just
        defined is similar, <br />
        but in the case of an array defined the way I just defined one,
        JavaScript numbers the different <br />
        values, or elements, automatically. (You can control the numbering
        yourself by defining <br />
        elements individually. See below.) And you refer to each element by
        writing the array name <br />
        —cities in this case—followed by a number enclosed in square brackets.
        cities[0] is <br />
        "Atlanta", cities[1] is "Baltimore", and so on. <br />
        Because JavaScript automatically numbers array elements, you have no say
        in the <br />
        numbering. The first element in the list always has an index of 0, the
        second element an index <br />
        of 1, and so on. <br />
        This is the alert I coded above, but now specifying an array element
        instead of an <br />
        ordinary variable. <br />
        alert("Welcome to " + cities[3]); <br />
        An array can be assigned any type of value that you can assign to
        ordinary variables. You <br />
        can even mix the different types in the same array (not that you would
        ordinarily want to). <br />
        var mixedArray = [1, "Bob", "Now is", true]; <br />
        In the example above, mixedArray[0] has a numerical value of 1,
        mixedArray[1] has a <br />
        string value of "Bob", and so on. <br />
        Things to keep in mind: <br />
        The first item always has an index of 0, not 1. This means that if the
        last item in the list <br />
        has an index of 9, there are 10 items in the list. <br />
        The same naming rules you learned for ordinary variables apply. Only
        letters, numbers, $ <br />
        and _ are legal. The first character can't be a number. No spaces.
        <br />
        Coders often prefer to make array names plural—cities instead of city,
        for example— <br />
        since an array is a list of things. <br />
        Like an ordinary variable, you declare an array only once. If you assign
        new values to an <br />
        array that has already been declared, you drop the var. <br />
